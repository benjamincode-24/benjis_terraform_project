# What is terraform.tfvars?
In Terraform, when you define variables 
(like aws_region), you also need to provide values for those variables.
A file named terraform.tfvars is a special 
file where you can set those variable values, 
so Terraform knows what to use when running your configuration.

Now when you run:

# Run this command to apply your Terraform configuration:
"terraform apply"
Terraform will automatically read terraform.tfvars 
and use "us-east-1" as the value of aws_region.
